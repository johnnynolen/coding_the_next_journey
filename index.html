    Background:
</h4>
<p id=2nd>
    I  left school at the end of grade ten to become a plumber <br>
    Because this was my only believed way that I could build... <br>
    A rewarding life that I would enjoy living due to not having <br>
    The same opportunities as other people.<br>
</p>
<h4 id='sub4'>
    Why I Chose To Learn How To Code:
</h4>
<p id=3rd>
    The reason i chose to learn how to code started long before I took my first class, <br>
    I took my first coding class because of a work place injury I suffered due someone else not doing their job correctly, <br>
    I fell in love with the learning process immediately and quickly started to believe that learning to code <br>
    Could change many peoples lives because it only requires readily available tools that most people have access too,<br>
    And people of all ages and ability levels are able to find a rewarding roll and become a valuable member of the team..<br>
    <br>
